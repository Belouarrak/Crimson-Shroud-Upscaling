# Crimson-Shroud-Upscaling
Ongoing texture upscaling project for the 3DS game Crimson Shroud for Citra Emulator.

## Project
This is a work-in-progress of an upscaling project allowing for Crimson Shroud to be rendered with higher fidelity when running on the 3DS Citra emulator.
The goal focuses on retaining the original textures as much as possible while rendering them at a higher resolution with a mix of AI upscaling techniques and manual retouching.

Every texture has been authored manually in some ways, not just leaving it up to the AI upscale.
